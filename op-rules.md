# Serious vs. memey op rules


## Serious ops
- They are the default for the regular op schedule (Wednesdays and Sundays at 1900 UK time).
- Always stick to your buddy team. Infantry always moves in teams of at least two people.
- Respect your in-game leaders and follow their orders.
- Leaders take their job seriously and lead by example.
- One life rule: no meta commentary.
- Protect civilians.
- **Play with the loadout you were given by the armoury system (no kitbashing).**
- Ask your leader for permission before picking up or using enemy assets.
- Follow rules of engagement. By default, PID targets and ask your leader for permission before engaging.
- Mission objectives in accordance with Laws of armed conflict (i.e. no hurting civilians or executing defenseless opponents).
- When the briefing starts, stay silent unless asking questions at the end.
- Only logistics and leadership roles can interact with the motorpool.


## Memey ops
- Features of serious ops don't apply.
- Must be clearly marked as memey.
- Can be scheduled as:
    + *coffee ops* (outside the regular op schedule)
    + *special occasion ops* in the regular op schedule (on occasions such as Christmas, Easter, New Year, Halloween, etc.; consult PXG Team before scheduling)
