# PXG Core Values

### Freedom
Prefer optional above mandatory.
Require as little mandatory training as reasonably possible, and limit gatekeeping for mission creation and specialized roles. Avoid op attendance quotas.

### Education and growth attitude
Instead of gatekeeping, educate/train our members and always encourage personal growth.

### Respect and assistance
Respect and readily help one another. A community only thrives when its people are happy.
Value time and effort people invest into the community.

### Fun
While realism is, to some extent, important, enjoyment of the community is the priority.
Free people from obligations to play uninteresting roles just because they would be realistic (e.g. logistics in small-scale ops).

### Simplicity and lightness
PXG is a group of friends who play quality Arma together.
Prefer simple and straightforward solutions above complex and labour-intensive ones.
Minimize the time investment required from the staff and the community.
The less moving parts, the less likely the machine is to break.

### Creativity
Embrace creative ideas of the community. Welcome new ideas and innovative ops, and provide constructive feedback to the people, who invest their time into the community.

### Transparency
Make decisions for the greater good of the community (including yourself).
Publicly announce decisions, provide reasoning for them, and encourage constructive discussion.

### Public praise
Raise good spirits in the community by publicly mentioning people who were generous to you.

### Conflict resolution
Respectfully deal with uninspiring stuff away from the eyes of the community. Then leave disappointment and irritation behind, and enjoy the community once again.
