# PXG Core Values

### Freedom
Prefer optional above mandatory.
Require as little mandatory training as reasonably possible, and limit gatekeeping for mission creation and slotting into specialized mission roles. Avoid op attendance quotas.

### Respect and assistance
We respect and readily help one another. A community only thrives when its people are happy.
We value the time and effort people invest into the community.

### Fun
While realism is to some extent important, enjoyment of the community is above it.

### Simplicity and lightness
Prefer simple and straightforward solutions above complex and labour-intensive ones.
Minimize the time investment required from the staff and the community.

### Creativity
Embrace creative ideas of the community. Welcome new ideas and innovative ops, and provide constructive feedback to the people, who invest their time into the community.

### Praise publicly
Raise good spirits in the community by publicly mentioning people, who were generous to you.

### Resolve conflict in private
Deal with uninspiring stuff away from the eyes of the community. Then leave disappointment and irritation behind, and enjoy the community once again.
